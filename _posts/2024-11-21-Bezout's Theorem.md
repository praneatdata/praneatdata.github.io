In previous semesters, I had the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of algebraic geometry, a field that intricately connects algebra and geometry. One of the central pillars of this domain is Bézout's Theorem, which offers a powerful framework for understanding the intersection of algebraic curves in the plane.

In my recent seminar for the MTH436 - Basic Algebraic Geometry course, I presented a detailed analysis of Bézout's Theorem, highlighting its significance and far-reaching applications across various mathematical contexts. This theorem not only plays a pivotal role in algebraic geometry but also provides key insights into solving problems involving intersections of curves.

The seminar aimed to unravel the essence of the theorem, its applications, and its profound implications in modern mathematics. You can explore my detailed report on the topic, which includes the theory and practical examples, in the attached link: [Bézout's Theorem & Its Applications](https://github.com/praneatdata/BezoutsTheorem/blob/main/B%C3%A9zout_s_Theorem___Its_Applications_Praneat_Data.pdf).
