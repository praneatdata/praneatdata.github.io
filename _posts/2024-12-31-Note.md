One main idea behind this page was to have something look cool on my profile, I will post my projects shots and would look cool. But today I retrospected this year and realised that I need to write it down somewhere, and having this page was a nice idea. So here I am writing this note to myself and all who are reading this.

Year 2024, this is the year people could call the character arc of my life, the person I enter this year as and the person I am leaving this year are two different people. I have explored my self, and the world around me, developed a sense of clearity to matters, became more confident and most importantly stared loving myself more.
