### Description

On February 8th, 2022, Propose Day, I began my journey into photography. After learning the "rules," I decided to start a Valentine’s series, and this is the first photo of that series. I attempted still-life photography to capture the emotion and intensity of the moment when someone proposes their love.

This shot was challenging; I had to tape the matchstick myself, arrange my phone, light the matches, and click the photo simultaneously. After going through numerous boxes of matches, I finally got the shot. You might notice that I lit the match representing the proposal first—this was intentional. It helps convey the image I had in mind: a man proposing to his love. The larger flame represents the man’s stature, while the smaller flame of the girl signifies her excitement.

I tend to overthink my shots after taking them, so some aspects might be harder to relate to. Feel free to share your thoughts on this shot; I'm happy to discuss it, so please reach out.
