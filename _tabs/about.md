Hi there! I'm Praneat Data, a college student currently studying Mathematics and Scientific Computing at IIT Kanpur. Welcome to my personal website, where I share my thoughts, achievements, and experiences as I navigate through my academic journey and beyond.

## Thoughts and Reflections

I use this space to share my thoughts on various topics that interest me, from photography to movie reviews. Writing allows me to reflect on my experiences, express my opinions, and engage with others who share similar interests.

Feel free to check out my Blog where I post about what is lingering in my mind.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy photography, having a nice cycle ride or just pick up my drawing pad and paint something. Whether it's Photography or painting, I find joy in playing around with colours.
